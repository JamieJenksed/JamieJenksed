# Hey ü§ô

## Welcome to my Github profile ü¶ù
*Stick around üêÄ I like guests *

My name is Jamie Jenks I'm a web developer (front-end, back-end, full-stack... I love it all)
In the future I'd love to be able to make more involved programs, like smart devices, desktop programs and video games.

Currently I've got a pretty small tech stack  
  |Languages| Libraries + other|
  |-----|-----|
  |HTML|PostgresSQL|
  |CSS|Less|
  |JS|React|
  |Java|Spring|
  |Python|Rest API|
  |PHP| Wordpress|
  
And more!
(I am also super willing to learn a new stack, I'm a fast learner!)

Aside from code...
I'm also a wife, married to a forever GM. I make up fan fiction about the Pathfinder campaign we play with our friends every weekend.
I also am teaching myself to play the piano,
And I bake chocolate chip cookies when I'm stressed.
